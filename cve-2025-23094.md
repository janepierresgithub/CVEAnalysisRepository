# CVE-2025-23094 Case Study

## Overview
This vulnerability affects the Mitel OpenScape 4000 Manager, enabling unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands via command injection.

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-23094  
- **Published Date:** January 2025  
- **Severity:** High (CVSS Score: 8.8)  
- **Affected Versions:** V11 R0.22.0 to R0.22.1, V10 R1.54.0 to R1.54.1  

## Technical Breakdown
The vulnerability is due to insufficient parameter sanitization in web requests. Attackers can inject malicious commands through unvalidated input fields.

### Exploit Example:
```
curl -X POST http://target-site.com/login -d "username=admin;rm -rf / --"
```
This demonstrates an injection where an attacker could execute destructive commands on the server.

## Impact
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Full system compromise.
- **Data Loss:** Potential deletion or modification of critical files.
- **System Downtime:** Service disruption due to unauthorized commands.

## Solutions & Recommendations
1. **Apply Security Updates:** Upgrade to the latest patched version provided by Mitel.
2. **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent command injection. Use allow-lists for acceptable input types.
3. **Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF):** Block malicious requests at the network perimeter.
4. **Limit System Privileges:** Run web applications with the least privilege necessary to limit potential damage.
5. **Conduct Code Reviews:** Regularly review application code for security flaws related to input handling.
